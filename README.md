 _Bringing true decentralization with DPoS_

LGCY Network is a DPoS, open-source blockchain protocol with industry-leading transaction speed and flexible utility. 
Running on the Libertas Protocol, the network aims to be the most decentralized dApp blockchain in the world.

Bringing true decentralization with DPoS by implementing the Libertas Protocol to the Super Representatives (GBs) system of governance. 
By splitting up the 27 GBs into three branches, limiting the power of each, and introducing terms to the governance system, no single large token holder will be able to gain an unbalanced amount of power.


## Tech

LGCY Network uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
- [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
- [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
- [Gulp] - the streaming build system
- [jQuery] - duh

And of course LGCY Network itself will be open source with a [public repository] on GitHub.
